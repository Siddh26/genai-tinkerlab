## Introduction

Generative AI is transforming how we interact with technology. From creating text and images to building intelligent agents, the potential applications are vast. This repository aims to provide a hands-on experience with various projects that leverage these capabilities.

You can find the latest releases and updates [here](https://github.com/Siddh26/genai-tinkerlab/releases).

## Projects Overview

### 1. AI Agents

Our AI Agents project explores how to create autonomous systems that can interact with users, perform tasks, and learn from their environment. This section includes:

- **Chatbots**: Build conversational agents that can answer questions or assist users.
- **Task Automation**: Create agents that can automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines traditional information retrieval with generative models. This section includes:

- **Document Retrieval**: Techniques to pull relevant documents based on user queries.
- **Content Generation**: Generate text that incorporates information from retrieved documents.

### 3. Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

Fine-tuning LLMs allows you to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks. This section includes:

- **Custom Datasets**: Use your own data to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Learn how to measure the effectiveness of your fine-tuned models.

### 4. Workflows and Integration

Understanding workflows is crucial for deploying AI solutions. This section covers:

- **End-to-End Pipelines**: Create workflows that encompass data collection, processing, and model deployment.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Learn how to integrate AI models into your applications seamlessly.
